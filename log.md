# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 6, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Learned how to acess the Google Maps API. Worked on basic map settings. Created a basic search bar â€“ no functionality yet, still figuring out how state and state managemenent works


**Thoughts** I've been having a tough relationship with React, but now, when I have an actual idea what I can do it feels managable. It's still very difficult at times, yet without all that code-overload-anxiety I find myself understanding some of the concepts faster.
